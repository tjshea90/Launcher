# CHECKPOINT 735 — read me first, then TASKS.md

**Written:** 2026-11-08T22:18:44Z · **tests:** all 5 fast checks green (gradle suite: see ship.sh)
**Branch:** `claude/new-session-2ax1r4` · **builds on:** `42fe590` (this checkpoint is the commit after it)

## Just done
BL1 review fixes in (9 of 10 findings; frozen status-bar row = disclosed limit): stamp renewal, wall-fail guard, retry reset, window origin, cache-only facts + real rotation check, in-place compose, teardown; unit suite 727/0

## Do this next
re-run cu x2 (main + branch ref) on the fixed code, then gate

*(resuming? CLAUDE.md's "FIRST ACTION OF EVERY SESSION" comes before "Starting a session" — do that one first, or autosave stays off all session.)*
